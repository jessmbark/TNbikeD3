# TN-Bike-Crashes-D3
 An SVG made with D3 depicting bicycle crashes in Tennessee during the first six months of 2024
---
This is an SVG that I created with D3 for the 2024 Lede Program. You can visit the webpage [here.](https://jessmbark.github.io/TNbikeD3/)

This visualization was made possible due to data collection from the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the Tennessee Department of Safety & Homeland Security.
